# ActiveTabHighlighterPlugin

What it is not:
- best implementation you ever saw

What is it:
- minimum implementation plugin
- gets the job of distinct highlight of active tab done (I'm personally using Darcula theme, and this has been 
    a nightmare for me for quite a while, to see the active tab, amongst the others)
- yes, the highlight colour is somewhat pink by default, now you can change it in Settings\Tools\Active Tab Highlighter Plugin

Installation instructions:
1. From JetBrains plugin store
    From File>Settings click Plugins from the side tree adn the click Browse repositories. Now just lookup it up by name "Active Intellij Tab Highlighter"
