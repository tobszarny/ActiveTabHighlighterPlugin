# ActiveTabHighlighterPlugin

What is it:
- minimum implementation plugin
- gets the job of distinct highlight of active tab done (I'm personally using Darcula theme, and this has been 
  a nightmare for me for quite a while, to see the active tab, amongst the others)
- yes, the highlight colour is somewhat pink by default, now you can change it in *Settings > Tools > Active Tab Highlighter Plugin*
