# ActiveTabHighlighterPlugin

What is it:

- minimum implementation plugin
- gets the job of distinct highlight of active tab done (I'm personally using Darcula theme, and this has been
  a nightmare for me for quite a while, to see the active tab, amongst the others)
- yes, the highlight colour is somewhat pink by default, now you can change it in *Settings > Tools > Active Tab Highlighter Plugin*
- now you can define separate colour for dark and light themes
- now you can define default colors for every new or plugin not configured project (IDE level) and override it individually on the
  project (Project level)
